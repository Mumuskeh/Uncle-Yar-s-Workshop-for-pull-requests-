-Module:
Russian Ammo Expansion [No_data]

----------------------------------------------------------
-Compatibility:

----------------------------------------------------------
-Explanation:

Three options are offered:
- 00 Original mod
- 01 Revised IDs
- 02 Arti's Ballistics

Option 00 only has fixes and additions. No further considerations.

Options 01 and 02 have the item's internal IDs renamed for better inventory ordering; I realize the original "russammo_" preffix was chosen to keep them together, but this way it should feel to "belong" more naturally among other ammo instead of standing apart.
Though this requires a new game if already using the mod in a save.

Option 02 was made for compatibility with for Arti's Ballistics. I only now realized both mods add the same ammo, so this disables what's already offered here to avoid redundancy and conflicts (which doesn't happen with the original "russamo" ID). These would be:
-9x18 7N25
-9x19 7N31
-7.62x39 7N23
-7.62x39 57-BZ-231 (the same as AB's BZ API if with a different name)
-9x39 PAB-9
It also has the Ammo Maker patch integrated, because AB uses the same craft system and items.
No actual compatibility with Arti's reworked system yet though.



All folders include the following additions to the mod:

- DLTX'd the assignment of ammo to guns and mags, so that the ammo is simply added, instead of the whole selection overwritten. This should be more compatible with other mods adding their own ammo as well.
- Trimmed redundant configs code. All ammo was already inheriting from one or another, but still repeating the already inherited data. No big thing, but should be a tiny bit more efficient.
- The icon file has been trimmed a bit and split, to reduce filesize and leave less empty space in memory.
- Text edited a bit. Old/damaged ammo are tagged as such in the name text. There were also short names unused, so I've assigned them. It should help unclutter the inventory from excess text covering the icons when using something like Utjan's QOL mods.
- Integration into the vanilla task rewards system.
- The Mags Redux patch has been integrated into the main files. It's not going to cause trouble if the player won't use Mags Redux anyway.

Integrated into:
Arszi's Mutant Bleeding + Arszi's Mutant Bleeding Optimization Pach
